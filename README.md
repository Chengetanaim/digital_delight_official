# Digital Delight

On this project me and my friend worked on creating an ecormmece website for this company called Digital Delight.  
I did the backend part and my friend did the designing.
The web application is for a company which sells electronic products so the owner can post all the products that they are selling.
Accounts can be created for customers and they can view products.
If they like the products that they see, they can contact or visit the company.

## What I learnt:

- working with a frontend developer
- focusing on only the backend side of creating an application
- listening to a client's requirements and being able to act on it
